- 👋 Hi, I’m @rmaxflo, I am a teacher of technical courses in computer science. 
- 👀 I'm interested in programming for the web and developing mobile applications without being attached to technologies.
- 🌱 I'm learning to program with Python, C++, JavaScript and other technologies like Vue, Node, React and Flutter. 
- 💞️ I try to collaborate with basic and advanced algorithms used in linear programming and metaheuristics. I'm studying for a master's degree in computational optimization.
- 📫 Feel free to get in touch by email or WhatsApp, or right here on git or other social networks.
